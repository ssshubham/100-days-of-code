### Day 0: December 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with Html and Html5 from freecodecamp. Refressed about topics like head, anchor, paragrph, image, input, checkboxes, radio buttons etc. 

**Thoughts**: It was good for me to start with these topics. Earlier I thought that these are very easy topics and it is not required for me to revise. But I was wrong. I had some confusions which got cleared today.

### Day 1: December 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with CSS selectors, properties, head and body tags, different types of styling, margins, paddings etc. 

**Thoughts**: It was good to know about different styling elements. Today was a bit more interesting after I got likes on twitter posts. It was my first post.
