# 100 Days Of Code - Log
##### (Shubham Srivastava)

### Day 0: December 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with Html and Html5 from freecodecamp. Refressed about topics like head, anchor, paragrph, image, input, checkboxes, radio buttons etc. 

**Thoughts**: It was good for me to start with these topics. Earlier I thought that these are very easy topics and it is not required for me to revise. But I was wrong. I had some confusions which got cleared today. 

**Link(s) to work**: [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
