##### (Shubham Srivastava)

### Day 0: December 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with Html and Html5 from freecodecamp. Refressed about topics like head, anchor, paragrph, image, input, checkboxes, radio buttons etc. 

**Thoughts**: It was good for me to start with these topics. Earlier I thought that these are very easy topics and it is not required for me to revise. But I was wrong. I had some confusions which got cleared today.

### Day 1: December 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with CSS selectors, properties, head and body tags, different types of styling, margins, paddings etc. 

**Thoughts**: It was good to know about different styling elements. Today was a bit more interesting after I got likes on twitter posts. It was my first post.

### Day 2: December 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued and completed basic CSS. Started with Applied Visual Design. Learned about text-align, background-color, shadow, strikethrough, underline, bold, root element, font-weight, font-size, line height, rgb colors, css variables and media queries.   

**Thoughts**: Earlier I thought that CSS is very easy. But after today's session I felt like, it is becoming more and more complex. Lot's of things to remember. But I feel good to know these things.
